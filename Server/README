cause of bug: changing the timezone of the system from +0 to Asia/Dubai +04

Solution:
Bug fixed by service cron restart.

How did the answer come to me? when I am on a relax state right after I become
desperate for an answer. I know deep inside that there is problem in the cron timing
because I noticed from [ */1 * * * * ] that the script is running but on a specific time
it is not.

What I learn from this debugging experience?
	- List down all the know facts
	- List all the anomalies like "when set to every minute the script is 
	  running while on a specific time it is not." In there I am able to
	  come up with a hypothesis.
	- Work on the hypothesis until you come up with a conclusive answer
	  before jumping into another hypothesis.
